      <h3>What is Community Supported Agriculture (CSA)?</h3>

      <p>
        CSA is a model of farming that connects consumers directly with local
        food production. Members of a CSA share in the benefits of sustainable
        agriculture by supporting farms in exchange for fresh, high-quality
        food. By hosting an animal, you become a vital part of this system,
        helping to raise pastured livestock in a way that benefits both the
        environment and the community.
